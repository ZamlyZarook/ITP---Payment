# ITP---Payment
An ITP Module project developed by seven members using Java, HTTP, CSS, and JavaServlet in Eclipse. The system allocates fuel quotas to vehicles and prevents black market fuel distribution during Sri Lankaâ€™s fuel crisis. I managed vehicle payments, reducing the fuel quota accordingly.
